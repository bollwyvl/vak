# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.1]
### Fixed
- pin `crowsetta` version to 1.1.1 in setup.py
  + so that `pip` doesn't install version 2.0, which causes an error

## [0.2.0]
### Added
- `vak.core.learncurve.test_one_model` function that makes it easier to
  measure frame and syllable error, etc., on a single trained model
- add `move_spects` method to `Dataset` so an instance of a `Dataset` is not locked to a 
  particular location

### Changed
- single-source version
  + using the "Warehouse" approach from the PyPA page (thanks Donald Stufft)
    <https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/#single-sourcing-the-version>
- rename `VocalizationDataset`, it's now just `Dataset` and is imported
  at top-level of package; both changes make code concise and reduce typing
  (and the `Vocalization` is implied anyway).

### Fixed
- syllable error rate calculated correctly for test data set by `vak.core.learning_curve.test`

## [0.1.0]
### Added
- add helper function to TestLearncurve that multiple unit tests can use to assert all outputs 
  were generated. Now being used to make sure bug fixed in 0.1.0a8 stays fixed.
- error checking in cli that raises ValueError when cli command is `learncurve` and the option
  'results_dir_made_by_main_script' is already defined in [OUTPUT] section, since running
  'learncurve' would overwrite it. 
- `dataset` subpackage that houses `Dataset` and related classes that facilitate creating data sets for training neural networks from heterogeneous data: audio files, files of arrays containing spectrograms, different annotation types, etc.
  - also includes modules for handling each data source
    + e.g. `audio.to_spect` creates spectrograms from audio files
    + `spect.from_files` creates a `Dataset` from spectrogram files
- `core` sub-package that contains / will contain functions that do heavy lifting: `learning_curve`, `train`, `predict`
  + `learning_curve` is a sub-sub-module that does both `train` and `test` of models, instead of having a separate `learncurve` and `summary` function (i.e. train and test). Still will confuse some ML/AI people that this "learning curve" has a test data step but whatevs
  + `cli` sub-package calls / will call these functions and handle any command-line-interface specific logic
     (e.g. making changes to `config.ini` files)

### Changed
- change name of `vak.cli.make_data` to `vak.cli.prep`
- structure of `config.ini` file
  + now specify either `audio_format` or `spect_format` in `[DATA]` section
  + and `annot_format` for annotations
- refactor `utils` sub-package
  + move several functions from `data` and `general` into a `labels` module

### Removed
- remove unused options from command-line interface: `--glob`, `--txt`, `--dataset`
- `skip_files_with_labels_not_in_labelset` option
  + now happens whenever `labelset` is specified; if no `labelset` is given then no filtering is done
- `summary` command-line option, since `learncurve` now runs trains models and also tests them on separate data set
- `silent_label_gap` option, because `Dataset` class determines if a label for unlabeled segments between other segments is needed, and if so automatically assigns this a label of 0 when mapping user labels to consecutive integers
  + this way user does not have to think about it
  + and program doesn't have to keep track of a `labels_mapping` file that saves what user specified

## [0.1.0a8]
### Fixed
- Fix how main loop in `learncurve` re-loads indices for grabbing subsets of training data after 
  generating them, and do so in a way that still allows for re-using subsets from previous runs

## [0.1.0a7]
### Added
- `vak.cli.summary` has `save_transformed_data` parameter and `vak.cli` passed value from
  `config.data.save_transformed_data` as the argument when calling `vak.cli.summary`

### Changed
- `vak.cli.summary` only saves transformed train/test data if `save_transformed_data` is `True`
- move a test from tests/unit_tests/test_utils.py into tests/unit_tests/test_utils/test_data.py

### Removed
- `vak.cli.summary` no longer saves copy of test data in results directory

## [0.1.0a6]
### Added
- add test for utils.data.get_inds_for_dur

### Changed
- learncurve gets indices for all train data subsets before starting training

## [0.1.0a5]
### Added
- Use `attrs`-based classes to represent sections of config.ini files 
 
### Changed
- rewrite `vak.cli` so it can deal with state of config.ini files
  + e.g. doesn't throw an error if `train_data_path` not declared as an option in [TRAIN] when running `vak prep` 
(since training data won't exist yet, doesn't make sense to throw an error).

### Removed
- remove code about `freq_bins` in a couple of places, since the number of frequency bins 
  in spectrograms is now just determined programmatically 
  + `vak.config.data` no longer has `freq_bins` field in DataConfig namedtuple
  + `make_data` no longer adds `freq_bins` option to [DATA] section after making data sets

## [0.1.0a4]
### Fixed
- add missing 'save_transformed_data' option to Data config parsing

## [0.1.0a3]
### Changed
- checkpoints saved in individual directories by `learncurve` so they are more cleanly segregated,
e.g. if user wants to point to a specific checkpoint when calling `predict`
- calling `vak prep config.ini` will run `vak.cli.make_data` function
  + so to generate a learning curve, the three steps now are:
  ```bash
  vak prep config.ini
  vak learncurve config.ini
  vak summary config.ini
  ```

### Fixed
- `vak.cli.train` runs all the way through, passes basic "does not crash" test
- `vak.cli.predict` runs all the way through, passes basic "does not crash" test

## [0.1.0a2]
### Changed
- description in setup.py (matches README + Github)
- move command-line interface logic out of __main__.py, into cli/cli.py
- `make_data` and `learncurve` functions use `tqdm` for progress bars

### Fixed
- main() knows to look for `configfile` command-line argument (not `config`)
- `config` module expands user (on Linux/Mac) for (some) directory names

## [0.1.0a1]
First release; still in pre-release
### Changed
- name change from 'songdeck' to 'vak'
